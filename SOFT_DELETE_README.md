# Soft Delete Functionality Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds soft delete functionality to the file management system. Instead of permanently deleting files from the database and Google Drive, files are marked as inactive using the `is_active` column while maintaining analytics data and removing vectors from the Pinecone database.

## Features

### 1. Soft Delete Implementation
- **Database**: Uses `is_active` column (BIT type) in `UploadedFiles` table
- **Default Value**: `1` (active) for all new and existing files
- **Soft Delete**: Sets `is_active = 0` when file is deleted
- **FileMetadata**: Sets `status = 'deleted'` for ingestion records

### 2. Vector Database Cleanup
- **Pinecone Integration**: Removes vectors associated with deleted files
- **Filter-based Deletion**: Uses `fileId` metadata to identify and remove vectors
- **Graceful Handling**: Continues operation even if Pinecone deletion fails

### 3. User Interface
- **Seamless Experience**: Files disappear from the dashboard immediately after deletion
- **Status Indicator**: Shows "Soft Delete Active" in the dashboard
- **Toast Notifications**: Provides feedback during deletion process
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed operations

### 4. Analytics Preservation
- **Historical Data**: Maintains file metadata for analytics purposes
- **Dashboard Stats**: Continues to show accurate statistics
- **Audit Trail**: Preserves creation and ingestion timestamps

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- Auto-migration adds this column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE UploadedFiles 
ADD is_active BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;

-- Update existing records to be active
UPDATE UploadedFiles 
SET is_active = 1 
WHERE is_active IS NULL;
```

### API Endpoints

#### Delete File: `DELETE /api/drive-files/delete`
- **Input**: `{ fileId: string }`
- **Process**: 
  1. Validates user authentication and file ownership
  2. Updates `UploadedFiles.is_active = 0`
  3. Updates `FileMetadata.status = 'deleted'`
  4. Removes vectors from Pinecone
- **Output**: `{ success: boolean, message: string, fileName: string }`

#### File Metadata: `GET /api/file-metadata`
- **Filter**: Excludes files with `status = 'deleted'`
- **Purpose**: Ensures deleted files don't appear in dashboard

#### Drive Files: `GET /api/drive-files`
- **Filter**: Cross-references with database to exclude inactive files
- **Purpose**: Maintains consistency between Google Drive and database

### Auto-Migration

The system automatically runs database migration on startup:

```typescript
// Runs once when database connection is established
export async function autoMigrate() {
  // Checks if is_active column exists
  // Adds column if missing
  // Updates existing records to be active
}
```

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
const handleDeleteFile = async (fileId: string) => {
  // Shows loading state
  // Calls soft delete API
  // Refreshes dashboard data
  // Provides user feedback
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Preservation**: Analytics and historical data remain intact
2. **User Experience**: Immediate feedback and seamless operation
3. **Vector Cleanup**: Prevents orphaned vectors in Pinecone
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintains record of all file operations
5. **Reversibility**: Soft deletes can be reversed if needed (future feature)

## Security Considerations

- **User Authentication**: All operations require valid JWT tokens
- **File Ownership**: Users can only delete their own files
- **Transaction Safety**: Database operations use transactions for consistency
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if external services fail

## Future Enhancements

1. **File Recovery**: Admin interface to restore soft-deleted files
2. **Permanent Deletion**: Scheduled cleanup of old soft-deleted files
3. **Bulk Operations**: Delete multiple files at once
4. **Deletion Reasons**: Track why files were deleted
5. **Notification System**: Email notifications for file deletions

## Testing

To test the soft delete functionality:

1. Upload a file through the dashboard
2. Click the delete button on any file
3. Verify the file disappears from the dashboard
4. Check that analytics data is preserved
5. Confirm vectors are removed from Pinecone

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration Fails**: Check database permissions and connection
2. **Files Still Visible**: Verify API filtering is working correctly
3. **Pinecone Errors**: Check API keys and network connectivity
4. **UI Not Updating**: Ensure refresh function is called after deletion

### Logs to Check

- Database migration logs on application startup
- Pinecone deletion warnings/errors
- API response errors in browser console
- Database transaction rollback messages
